murder-for-hire hit against her ex-NFLer husband in the Bahamas</a>, claims she has been unable to see her children since she returned to the US for the holidays.</p><p>Lindsay Shiver alleges in a motion filed in the Superior Court of Thomas County, Georgia, on Jan. 3 that Robert Shiver has prevented her from visiting their three children and kept their whereabouts unknown, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to WDHN.</a></p><p>The couple share three sons, all under the age of 12.</p><p>The former beauty queen was permitted to return to her parent’s home in Alabama on Dec. 22 under the ruling while she&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">awaits the murder-for-hire trial in the Bahamas</a>.</p><p>However, the motion claims Robert Shiver allegedly broke an agreement that would allow the children to visit Lindsay under the stipulation that her parents supervise.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Lindsay Shiver has filed a new motion saying that her estranged husband is preventing her from seeing their children while she’s home in the US before her Bahamas trial. <span class=credit>Instagram/Lindsay Shiver</span></figure><p>“The Plaintiff (Robert Shiver) has denied the Defendant (Lindsay Shiver) any in-person contact with the children during the holiday season,” her attorney wrote in the motion, according to the outlet.</p><p>Lindsay Shiver’s lawyers argue that she’s been allowed to speak to her children once — over FaceTime on one of the children’s devices on Christmas Day — but has since been unable to contact them.</p><p>Lindsay Shiver was not permitted to travel to Georgia, where she lived with her estranged husband.</p><p>“It is believed that the children have been left in the care of babysitters for extended periods during the holidays when they could have been in Alabama with their mother and extended family members who love them,” her attorney said.</p><figure

children know the Defendant (Linday Shiver) is at their grandparents’ home in Alabama, and the youngest is especially distraught.”</p><p>Robert Shiver, 38, had pleaded for the judge to strike down her request to return to the US, explaining he’s “thankful to be alive” after her failed attempt on his life.</p><p>“After reviewing the indictment, this was a situation close to happening … I’m concerned for the safety of myself,” the former Auburn University football player&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>&nbsp;after the Dec. 21 ruling.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image

items from the home Georgia they once shared before she allegedly plotted to have him killed.</p><p>Robert Shiver allegedly has cut off access to financial resources on multiple occasions, according to the motion.</p><p>Lindsay Shiver had been&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">remanded to the Bahamas since July</a>, though she had been out of prison under the conditions that she wear an electric monitoring device and adhere to a curfew.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Lindsay Shiver was arrested in July after police uncovered a plot she was allegedly making to kill her husband. <span class=credit>Daniel William McKnight for the NY Post</span></figure><p>Shiver is accused of instructing her barman lover Adrien Bethel, 28, and alleged assassin Faron Newbold Jr., 29, to murder Robert Shiver amid&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their increasingly bitter divorce.</a></p><p>The mother of three allegedly sent a series of texts to Bethel asking him to “kill” her husband.</p><p>The plot was foiled after local police&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unearthed texts that detailed&nbsp;</a>the hit during an unrelated investigation of a break-in at the waterfront bar where Bethel worked.</p><p>Both Lindsay Shiver and Bethel denied seriously pursuing a murder-for-hire plan.</p><p>Before their marriage’s collapse, the Shivers split their time between a multimillion-dollar Thomasville, Georgia, mansion and a luxury spread in the exclusive Bahamian enclave of Baker’s Bay.</p><p>The couple met while Robert Shiver was the Auburn University football team captain in 2007.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The murder-for-hire trial is set to begin on
