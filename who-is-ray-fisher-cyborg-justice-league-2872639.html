He spoken out against Joss Whedon more than once.</strong> On Monday, June 29, Ray reposted of a video of himself from Comic-Con 2017 speaking about Joss after he stepped in for director <strong>Zack Snyder</strong> to finish&nbsp;Justice League. “I’d like to take a moment to forcefully retract every bit of this statement,” Ray tweeted. In the original video, Ray said: “Joss is a good guy, and Zack picked a good person to clean up and finish up for him,” while sitting next to co-star <strong>Jason Momoa</strong> Zack originally stepped away from the film due to a family death.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’d like to take a moment to forcefully retract every bit of this statement: <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/1ECwwu6TG1</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-13>— Ray Fisher (@ray8fisher) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>June 29, 2020</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-15><strong>2. He’s best known for playing Cyvorg/Victor Stone.</strong> Ray was announced to be joining DC’s&nbsp;Justice League&nbsp;film series in April 2014, originally making his debut alongside<strong> Ben Affleck</strong> and <strong>Henry Cavill</strong> in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a>. He reprised the role in 2017’s Justice League, starring with both Ben and Jason, as well as <strong>Gal Gadot</strong>’s Wonder Woman and <strong>Ezra Miller</strong>’s the Flash. The well-loved character is a founding member of the Justice League, a star athlete who became part robot and part human after a tragic accident.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16><strong>3. He got his start in theatre.</strong> Prior to his roles on the big screen, Ray trained at the Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey. He played Tom Robinson in their production of&nbsp;To Kill A Mockingbird, in addition to appearing in&nbsp;Macbeth. He later gained notoriety playing the legendary boxer <strong>Muhammad Ali</strong> in play Fetch Clay, Make Man, gaining 20 pounds for the role. “I started eating anything I could get my hands on. I was eating steaks for breakfast,” Ray explained in a 2013 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times</a>. “Protein drinks on top of that. Ali never lifted weights. But he had a naturally bigger frame than I did, so in order for me to get to his size I had to lift — bench presses, curls, squats, calf raises. I had to get used to a new body.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ray-fisher-justice-league-abusive-set-embed.jpg alt="Ray Fisher" width=620 height=930 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-18><strong>4.
