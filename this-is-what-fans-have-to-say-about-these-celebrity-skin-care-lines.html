Some fans might say that it all started with Kylie Jenner and her infamous lip kits, as well as beauty influencers on YouTube and how they started to branch out and release their own beauty products in collaboration with brands, and later on their own beauty brands themselves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The expansion into skin care was a relevantly recent move by celebs who were already involved in the beauty community or wanted to expand their business and have a leg up in the business. It is always fun and interesting to see when celebrities' major endeavors are indeed a passion project or just a cash grab, the deciding power in that matter are indeed the fans and consumers who review the products as they attempt to support their favorite celebrities or genuinely try a new product. So, here's what fans said about celebrity beauty lines and whether they are worth the shot.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="These Celebrities Made It Big As Entrepreneurs">These Celebrities Made It Big As Entrepreneurs</a></span></p><h2 id=nobody-expected-brad-pitt-to-release-a-skin-care-line-but-he-did><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Nobody Expected Brad Pitt To Release A Skin Care Line, But He Did</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2022,<a href=#> legendary actor Brad Pitt</a> announced the launch of his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">brand-new skin care brand named "Le Domaine Skincare."</a> Most fans were surprised by this move as no one saw it coming. To the knowledge of fans, Pitt mainly experimented with making wine and sharing a vineyard with ex-wife, Angelina Jolie. Initially, fans were aesthetically pleased with the packaging, weird as it is, but they were then left speechless by the expensive price tag and were skeptical about the efficacy of the products.</p><h2 id=hailey-bieber-released-a-minimal-skin-care-line><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Hailey Bieber Released A Minimal Skin Care Line</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Model and influencer Hailey Bieber is known for her trendsetting looks, but her skin care line was not as universally appealing <a href=#>as the looks she puts together</a>. Hailey Bieber launched her skin care line "Rhode" in July 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and it immediately sold out in ten minutes</a>, as expected. The products looked clean cut and with very high grade ingredients. Overall, fans liked her products, but others complained about the price and with a massive gripe against her lip plumpers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Hailey Bieber's Skincare Products Are Leaving Fans Furious (And In Pain)">Hailey Bieber's Skincare Products Are Leaving Fans Furious (And In Pain)</a></span></p><h2 id=scarlett-johansson-decided-to-stop-endorsing-beauty-brands-and-launched-her-own><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Scarlett Johansson Decided To Stop Endorsing Beauty Brands And Launched Her Own</span></h2><p>Scarlett Johansson has been the face of numerous beauty brands like L'Oreal and Dolce and Gabbana. In March 2022, seemingly a big year for celebrity beauty brands, the actress released her skin care line called "The Outset." Not the most expensive brand on the list, fans were pleased with the aesthetic and were kind of relieved that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the brand did not claim to be the new miracle cure for anything.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=harry-styles-hoped-his-beauty-and-wellness-brand-would-be-pleasing-to-fans><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Harry Styles Hoped His Beauty and Wellness Brand Would Be Pleasing To Fans</span></h2><p>In 2021, Harry Styles released a nail polish line that later expanded in 2022 into a vegan, cruelty-free make up line as well as a couple of skin care products. Fans think that the brand is a bit too avant garde for their taste, <a href=#>not unlike Harry Styles himself</a>, and too overpriced. So, many fans have passed on being pleased by Harry Styles' "Pleasing" line.</p><h2 id=of-course-kim-kardashian-released-skkn-by-kim-as-part-of-her-beauty-empire><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Of Course, Kim Kardashian Released SKKN by Kim As Part Of Her Beauty Empire</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By now, the market is over saturated with overpriced Kim Kardashian products. From shapewear, to makeup, to clothing, Kim Kardashian's latest endeavor wasn't as embraced by fans as her other business babies. Fans do not usually invest in 90 dollar products without some proof of their efficacy, which is a problem Kim Kardashian faced when trying to promote her new line.</p><h2 id=millie-bobby-brown-has-a-skin-care-line-dedicated-to-young-adults><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Millie Bobby Brown Has A Skin Care Line Dedicated To Young Adults</span></h2><p>Launched back in 2019, British young actress Millie Bobby Brown launched her beauty and skin care line named "Florence" mainly targeting young adults. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with Allure</a>, Brown said "I don't know anything about beauty and skin care, that's why I created this.

Though Pharrell is known for his glowing skin and age defying youthful look, not many saw this brand coming. However, the line got raving reviews for its cleanser, its ingredient list, and the efficacy of the products. Although the products carry a hefty price tag, but experts think that the line is definitely worth it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGjYra0edahmK1llpa7tHnHmq2eZaSkerSt2GaYm6elqXq1tMSsnGablaGyo77IrbBmq5ueu26vwKucZqSZo7K0ew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./tiger-wood-net-worth-investment-deals.html>&#171;&nbsp;Tiger Woods' Net Worth Was Partially Built By An Exclusive Investment Deal That Fans Are Unware Of</a>
