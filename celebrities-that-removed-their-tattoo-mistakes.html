Most of the time, this manifests as a messy divorce or a stint in rehab. After all, these celebrities aren't immune to the mistakes we all make in life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One mistake that some famous figures can't seem to avoid? The regrettable tattoo. Celebs mark their bodies in an artistic and permanent way. According to Harris Interactive, one in five American adults have a tattoo, and celebs are no different. Some love their ink for the rest of their lives while others wish they'd never gone down the road of needles and skin-centered artwork.</p><p>Those that regret their tattoos end up getting them removed. This is done with either laser treatments or skin grafts--both of which are lengthy and painful procedures. Read on for a list of 10 celebrities who have gone through the procedure of having their tattoos removed.</p><h2 id=kelly-osbourne---keyboard-tattoo>10. Kelly Osbourne - Keyboard Tattoo</h2><p>You would think that <a title="Kelly Osbourne Net Worth" href=#>Kelly Osbourne</a>, controversial fashionista and daughter of <a title="Ozzy Osbourne Net Worth" href=#>Ozzy</a> and <a title="Kelly Osbourne Net Worth" href=#>Sharon Osbourne</a>, would have few regrets. That's not the case when it comes to the keyboard tattoo she had on her right forearm. In November 2013, she posted a video of the keyboard getting removed at her first laser session on her Instagram. Along with posting the video, she said, "I did the crime I am now doing the time! #NoPainNoGain!" You can hear in the video that this was a painful decision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=pharrell-williams---full-sleeves-tattoo-removal>9. Pharrell Williams - Full Sleeves Tattoo Removal</h2><p><a title="Pharrell Williams Net Worth" href=#>Pharrell Williams</a> has been in the news a lot lately since he won the coveted Producer of the Year award at the 2014 Grammy Awards (sporting that now-famous oversized hat). You may have noticed during his Grammy acceptance speeches that his arms were curiously devoid of the numerous tattoos in which they were once covered. Rather than using lasers as is traditional in tattoo removal, in 2008 Pharrell instead went with an experimental procedure to cover his tattooed arms with new skin--like a skin graft. Think this is an expensive procedure? You'd be right. In 2008, Pharrell told Vogue "It's going to be pricey, but worth it."</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-jolie---billy-bob-tattoo>8. Angelina Jolie - Billy Bob Tattoo</h2><p><a title="Angelina Jolie Net Worth" href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> has gone through a real journey when it comes to tattoo removal. When she was married to <a title="Billy Bob Thornton Net Worth" href=#>Billy Bob Thornton</a> from 2000 to 2003 (her second marriage), she got a Billy Bob tattoo, along with a stylish dragon, on her left arm just below the shoulder. After the marriage ended in 2003, she regretted getting the tattoo. According to The Telegraph, she said "I'll never be stupid enough to have a man's name tattooed on me again." She had the "Billy Bob" lasered off her skin first, leaving the dragon behind. Later, she had the dragon removed as well and covered that area with new tattoos--rows of coordinates representing where each of her children were born.</p><p></p><h2 id=eva-longoria---nine-tattoo>7. Eva Longoria - Nine Tattoo</h2><p>Perhaps <a title="Eva Longoria Net Worth" href=#>Eva Longoria</a>, winner of the 2007 People's Choice Award for Favorite Female TV Star for Desperate Housewives, should have taken a cue from Angeline Jolie. The actress had gotten a "Nine" tattoo on the back of her neck to represent her athlete husband <a title="Tony Parker Net Worth" href=#>Tony Parker</a>'s basketball jersey number. As is often the case with celebrity relationships, this marriage didn't last. When Eva filed for divorce in 2010, that tattoo didn't seem very practical anymore. Eva was spotted in 2012 with her Nine tattoo replaced with a big red splotch: proof that she's in the process of getting it removed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=kathy-griffin---ring-tattoo>6. Kathy Griffin - Ring Tattoo</h2><p><a title="Kathy Griffin Net Worth" href=#>Kathy Griffin</a>'s marriage is one of the sadder stories in this list. Kathy married love-of-her-life Matt Moline in 2001, only to have him reportedly steal over $70,000 dollars from her. After the marriage ended in 2006, the comedienne was left with one permanent reminder of the failed married: a wedding ring tattoo. Since she didn't like wearing rings, the pair had their rings tattooed instead, a bummer now that the marriage is kaput. Kathy told the Windy City Times in 2012, "I have one tattoo on my whole body like an ***hole and it's a f***ing wedding ring and I'm divorced." She's now in the process of getting it removed.</p><p></p><h2 id=50-cent---arm-tattoos>5. 50 Cent - Arm Tattoos</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Few of us would expect to think of <a title="50 Cent Net Worth" href=#>50 Cent </a>as a serious actor, at least when he first started releasing rap records in the late '90s. Yet, that's 50 cent's aspirations these days. Unfortunately, he felt that his tattoo-covered arms held him back from his future acting prospects. The solution? Get them removed. He told People Magazine, "It cuts down on the amount of time I have to spend in makeup covering them up." The procedure seems to have paid off. 50 Cent had roles in 8 movies from 2011 through 2013 and has five more planned for 2014 and 2015.</p><p></p><h2 id=megan-fox---marilyn-monroe-tattoo>4. Megan Fox - Marilyn Monroe Tattoo</h2><p><a title="Megan Fox Net Worth" href=#>Megan Fox</a>, winner of the 2009 Choice Summer Movie Star - Female from the Teen Choice Awards for her role in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, is often talked about for her appearance. She continually makes it on hot lists from men's magazines. She's also had scrutiny for recent plastic surgery. Another aspect of her appearance that has made the news lately is the removal of the <a title="Marilyn Monroe Net Worth" href=#>Marilyn Monroe</a> tattoo on her right forearm. When asked why she was removing it, she told Amica Magazine, "It is a negative character, as she suffered from personality disorders and was bipolar. I do not want to attract this kind of negative energy in my life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=charlie-sheen---denise-tattoo>3. Charlie Sheen - Denise Tattoo</h2><p><a title="Charlie Sheen Net Worth" href=#>Charlie Sheen</a> has been in the media for decades now. His acting career took off in the 1980s and he's starred in dozens of movies and TV shows ever since. Lately, though, his relationships have been front and center when it comes to celebrity gossip. His rocky marriage to <a title="Denise Richards Net Worth" href=#>Denise Richards</a> only lasted four years, from 2002 to 2006, but that was more than enough time for Charlie to get a "Denise" tattoo on his left wrist. Denise quickly followed suit by getting her own "Charlie" tattoo on her leg. After their marriage ended, Charlie married <a title="Brooke Mueller Net Worth" href=#>Brooke Mueller</a> in 2008, and she wasn't too happy about the "Denise" tattoo. She asked him to get it removed and he obliged. That marriage then ended in 2011.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mark-wahlberg---6-tattoos>2. Mark Wahlberg - 6 Tattoos</h2><p><a title="Mark Wahlberg Net Worth" href=#>Mark Wahlberg</a> started his career in the music industry in the hip hop group Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. In the end, though, acting was his passion and he's made a successful transition into the world of movies. You'd think that his choice to remove his six tattoos, including a <a title="Bob Marley Net Worth" href=#>Bob Marley</a> tattoo on his left shoulder, was based on getting more movie roles (like 50 Cent on this list), but it wasn't. Mark told <a title="Matt Lauer Net Worth" href=#>Matt Lauer</a> on the Today Show, "I don't want to have my kids getting tattoos.... I’m taking my two oldest kids with me to the [tattoo removal] procedure, where they can see how painful that is."</p><p></p><h2 id=johnny-depp---winona-forever-tattoo>1. Johnny Depp - Winona Forever Tattoo</h2><p>Sometimes celebrities get creative with their tattoo removals. Case in point: <a title="Johnny Depp Net Worth" href=#>Johnny Depp</a>'s "Winona Forever" tattoo. Johnny was in a serious relationship with <a title="Winona Ryder Net Worth" href=#>Winona Ryder</a> and they were engaged from 1990 to 1993. He decided to show his love by getting "Winona Forever" tattooed on his right arm. After the relationship ended, he didn't want it to say "Winona" anymore. Rather than getting the whole tattoo removed like the other celebrities on this list, he had only part of the tattoo removed. Now, the tattoo says "Wino Forever."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmacnZyar7O106KcrGWkna61edGepKiulZl6tbTEoqlmrJGpwbC7jKagrKyRoLK0ew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./celine-dion-vs-madonna-who-has-a-higher-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Celine Dion Vs Madonna: Who Has A Higher Net Worth?</a>
