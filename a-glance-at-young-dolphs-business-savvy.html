artist</a> before his untimely death in November. Making money being independent can be challenging, but Dolph's business savvy is what made him succeed. He had to think out the box for ways to promote his music and get money on his own terms. These are seven instances of Young Dolph's brilliant <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">business mind</a>.</p><h2 id=patience-in-the-process>Patience In The Process</h2><p>In 2018, Young Dolph stated that he declined a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$22 million deal</a> with a major label. Many would think he's crazy for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">declining that kind of money </a>and accept the offer in a heartbeat. It demonstrates the faith he had himself getting more money in the long run by staying an independent artist. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Indie connect</a> mentions the benefits that comes with being independent. This includes keeping 100% of the profits, artists being able to own their masters instead of a major label and having more control on how to manage and market their career.</p><h2 id=running-his-own-label>Running His Own Label</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Young Dolph created his label Paper Route Empire in 2010. Despite having an independent label, he's had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard success </a>with his albums charting on the Top 200 albums. With 5 of his albums being in the top 20. His two collaboration albums with label mate Key Glock charting at #8 and his last solo album Rich Slave at #4. Young Dolph said on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">XXL interview</a>, "I just been a fan of music and I know I always wanted to do it myself and I wanted to do it my way. So, I told myself if I ever start doing music, I’ma do it my way. That’s what made me start my own label."</p><h2 id=the-protege>The Protege</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The most successful artist on Paper Route Empire next to Young Dolph, Key Glock, adds to the hype surrounding their label. His solo projects have all <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">charted well</a> on Billboard. His most recent mixtape Yellow Tape 2 being his highest charting project at #7. The many collaborations between Young Dolph and Key served as excellent cross promotion.</p><h2 id=saying-no-to-a-mainstream-rapper>Saying No To A Mainstream Rapper</h2><p>Fellow Memphis rapper Yo Gotti seen the buzz Young Dolph was getting and wanted him to sign with his label. Just like the $22 million offer from the major label, he declined. Another example displaying of his philosophy of being his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">own boss</a>. The business decision seemed to be taken personally by Yo Gotti as many believe that is what prompted the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> feud between them</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside The Extraordinary Business Mind Of Ryan Reynolds</a></span></p><h2 id=generosity-pays-off>Generosity Pays Off</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was a controversy in Duke University when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two baristas got fired</a> for playing a Young Dolph song. He got word of what happened and flew them out to the Rolling Loud festival in Miami and gave them each $20,000. With Rolling Loud being a major music festival, many more are going to notice and definitely gained some new fans with this generous act.</p><h2 id=the-lamborghini-giveaway>The Lamborghini Giveaway</h2><p>In promotion for his album Rich Slave, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dolph ran a contest </a>for fans that pre-ordered the album or bought merchandise bundles. By doing that, they would get the chance to win a Lamborghini like the one depicted on the album cover. It doesn't seem to be a coincidence Rich Slave became his highest charting album after this giveaway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=real-estate-for-his-children>Real Estate For His Children</h2><p>Real estate agent Tim Jackson posted on his Instagram after Young Dolph’s death about the rapper’s own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">real estate investments</a>. Dolph had purchased over 100 homes in his city of Memphis. Jackson added, “he [Young Dolph] also purchased a foreclosure for his children every year for their birthdays. He told me this himself when we met. I admired this about him and even challenged him to rap more about this side of his hustle.” On another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post,</a> Jackson went into further detail about this side of Young Dolph.</p><p>Young Dolph told Jackson, "the goal is by the time they turn 18, they'll have 18 properties and they will essentially have wealth. They'll have the equity in the properties because all the properties are paid off, paid for by cash. Then they'll also have the residual income each month, from the rent that will multiply" and "that will increase through inflation." Jackson concluded that his children's net worth would definitely be in the millions when they become 18. His children were already in a terrific position with the success their father had as a artist, but his transactions assure his kids and the generations to come will be well off financially.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Genius Of Lauren Conrad: A Peek Inside The Designer's Business Mind</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hip Hop Pun</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Indie Connect</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Music Charts Archive</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">XXL</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Recent Times</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hypebeast</a>, <a href=#>Tim Jackson&nbsp;</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSubrPLmqWcnV2WwW7Fzq6loGWUpLmxtNJmma6rmaOytL%2BMrJivrqlk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./christoph-sanders.html>&#171;&nbsp;Christoph Sanders Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</a>
