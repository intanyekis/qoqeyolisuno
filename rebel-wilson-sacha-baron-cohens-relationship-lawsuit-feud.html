While Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat was a profitable and star-making vehicle, some of <a href=#>Baron Cohen's other movies failed at the box office</a>, and Grimsby didn't do very well. In an interview on the radio back in 2014, she said he harassed her on the final shooting day. Based on her comments, it seems that they had a <strong>terrible, negative, and unprofessional relationship</strong>.</p><p>It's unclear if the actors met before shooting the movie. Since they haven't said they did, it seems their time together on set was their only interaction.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/rebel-wilson-2nd-annual-academy-museum-gala-held-at-academy-museum-of-motion-pictures.jpg><p>Wilson said that Baron Cohen spoke inappropriately to her and kept talking about body parts.

She said:</p><p>“Every day he’s like, ‘Just go naked, it will be funny. Remember in Borat when I did that naked scene? It was hilarious. On the last day, I thought I’d obviously won the argument and he got a body double to do the naked scene.”</p><p>What Are Some Of The Most Scandalous Characters Sacha Baron Cohen Has Played?

This could be because, when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Baron Cohen talked about his acting career</a> in a rare interview with The Guardian, he explained that he likes to keep to himself.

While she revealed her difficult experience with Baron Cohen in March 2024, she mentioned an actor harassing her several years ago. According to her, his team didn't want her to talk about it.
