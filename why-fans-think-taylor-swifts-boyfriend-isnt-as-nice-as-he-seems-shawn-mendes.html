We often see characters taking them in movies or on TV shows, like the Seinfeld episode when Jerry pretends to hate Melrose Place and it turns out that he's totally lying. Some of us might be skeptical, but others believe that these tests work. But what if a celebrity took a lie dectector test... and said something interesting about a popular singer and her boyfriend? And what if that singer was <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether we're <a href=#>wondering about Taylor and Joe's relationship</a> or listening to <a href=#>songs Taylor wrote about Joe</a>, we can't help but be totally invested in this high-profile love story. Since Taylor doesn't talk much about her relationship, fans have to rely on what other people say. Shawn Mendes took a lie detector test and revealed how he feels about Joe Alwyn, and people were amazed to hear what he had to say.</p><p>Keep reading to find out why fans think that Taylor Swift's boyfriend isn't as nice as he seems.</p><h2 id=what-does-shawn-think-about-joe>What Does Shawn Think About Joe?</h2><p>There are always rumors about Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn, whether fans wonder if <a href=#>the couple is secretly getting married</a> or if they're still together.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair interviewed Shawn Mendes</a> and had the popular singer take a lie detector test. According to E! News, Shawn Mendes started off being kind and polite, saying, "I've never personally met Joe, but he looks like a sweet guy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the person in charge of the lie detector test said, "You're not telling the truth. You're being deceptive," Shawn said, "I'm lying a little bit? Yeah, I mean, he's kind of got a little bit of a villain look about him. He looks like a nice guy but, like, he at any movement could turn into a villain, you know?" Shawn also talked about Joe's eyes, saying, "He's got really blue eyes and I struggle with eyes that blue, you know? Like I find it easier to trust brown eyes."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Joe Alwyn Have The Lowest Net Worth Of All Taylor Swift's Boyfriends?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were curious about the results of this lie detector test, with many people discussing it on Reddit. Of course, we always want friends to describe our partners as nice, as it would be pretty awkward for them to say that they don't like who we've chosen to date. But fans are curious about why people don't talk much about Joe Alywn.</p><p>In one Reddit thread, one fan posted, "It’s so weird how cagey her friends get when asked about Joe. I know they’re a 'private' couple but people don’t have to totally shut down and panic when asked about him lol. He’s an actor. They’re in a known relationship. It’s like no one has actually met the guy."</p><p>Another fan said that when Taylor's pals talk about her boyfriend, they all say that he's nice, but they don't have much more to add. The fan wrote, "It's so bizarre that Taylor's friends don't have much to say about Joe beyond 'he seems like a nice person.' Like, haven't they met him???"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some fans couldn't help but see the humor in the situation, since it's pretty funny that Shawn Mendes began talking about how nice Joe Alwyn seems and then began talking about his eyes. One fan joked, "Wow Shawn really fell apart under the slightest amount of pressure. Shawn: Joe seems nice. Man: My nonsense box says you’re lying. Shawn: okay but for real he looks like the actual devil."</p><p>It does seem like Taylor's friends would know Joe well and would be able to describe him, so it's no wonder that we're all so confused about why Joe is only called a "nice guy." It's possible that no one has spent that much time with him, but it does seem like Taylor would introduce her good friends to her boyfriend, especially since they've been in a serious relationship for a few years now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Joe Alwyn And Taylor Swift Met</a></span></p><h2 id=taylor-and-joe>Taylor And Joe</h2><p>While Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn keep much of their relationship quiet, Joe did share something: that he is now a fan of The Office. According to E! News, Joe said, "I'm currently watching the U.S. Office, which I've never seen before." The publication noted that Taylor loves that show, so it seems like he's watching it because they're dating.</p><p>Although Shawn Mendes said that while Joe Alwyn seemed nice, he wasn't so sure about Joe's eyes, Taylor's friend and collaborator Ed Sheeran has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">talked about Taylor and Joe's relationship</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Rare Photos Of Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn Out And About</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Insider.com, Ed said that Taylor bakes and cooks for Joe and they love movies and exercise. Back in 2017, when the couple hadn't been going out together very long, Ed explained, "He's really nice. Really, really friendly, really good dude. They are very much in love, they have quite a low-key relationship, which Taylor likes. It's normal, and no one really knows about it right now."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Tidbits About Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn's Relationship (That Tay Wants To Keep Quiet)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdm66vv4ytn6Kmm2LBosXLqKlmq6ees7W%2FjJumsp6inrKvsIyiqqesXZbAbrrInJxmmaNitaZ50p6cpqtdqLWiw81mpJ6mlJrAcA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bill-romanowski-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bill Romanowski Net Worth How Much is Romanowski Worth?</a>
