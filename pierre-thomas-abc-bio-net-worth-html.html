He has a clear vision about his job as a journalist, and every day he comes to work prepared to be the best in the business. He has been interested in journalism ever since his early childhood. At age 12, he had discovered that he wanted to be a journalist upon watching the news show, World News Tonight, featuring Peter Jennings and Max Robinson.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Thomas is the youngest of his five siblings born to a typical southern Virginia family consisting of factory worker father (father worked at Lynchburg Foundry)&nbsp;and homemaker mother.

His working-class family always wanted him to do good in his studies. He was a bookish kid, feeble in sports, and a salutatorian, in his high school.
