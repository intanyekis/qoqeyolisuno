But was his mother, Connie Zastoupil, entirely unsupportive of his career? Here's everything we know about her and her relationship with Quentin throughout the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Adam Sandler Could've Lost His Life Had He Said Yes To This Quentin Tarantino Role</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-quentin-tarantino-39-s-mother-connie-zastoupil>Who Is Quentin Tarantino's Mother, Connie Zastoupil?</h2><p>Connie McHugh-Zastoupil is a 75-year-old nurse based in Tennessee. She gave birth to Quentin, her first child when she was just 16 years old. She was briefly married to the director's father, Tony Tarantino, who was a law student in Los Angeles. He was five years older than her. But because both of them were still young, they split soon after their son was born. After that, Connie decided to move back to Tennessee where she attended a nursing school.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following her graduation, Connie headed back to LA with her son. There she met piano bar musician, Curtis Zastoupil who she eventually remarried. Curt legally adopted Quentin and treated him like a real son. He supported the young boy's love for cinema by frequently taking him to the movie theater. But it's from his biological father that Quentin got his knack for acting.</p><h2 id=who-is-quentin-tarantino-39-s-father-tony-tarantino>Who Is Quentin Tarantino's Father, Tony Tarantino?</h2><p>In 1960, talent agent Henry Wilson offered to give 20-year-old Tony Tarantino an acting career. But after saying that he'd have to sleep with him first, Tony punched Wilson in the face, knocking him down to the floor. As a result, Wilson blacklisted Tony from Hollywood and New York acting gigs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Determined to pursue acting, Tony changed his name to Tony Maro and was able to get jobs as an extra in Paramount. But eventually, he was kicked out of the lot when the producers found out about his true identity. Tony, 81, also worked as a producer — credited for the films, Prism and Underbelly Blues.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Explain What 'John Wick' Would Be Like If It Was Directed By Quentin Tarantino</a></span></p><p>In 2010, Quentin said he's never had a relationship with his father at all. "Well, I never knew my father — That's the thing. I never knew him," he said. "He wanted to be an actor — Now he's an actor only because he has my last name. But he was never part of my life. I didn't know him. I've never met him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-quentin-tarantino-39-s-mother-really-thinks-of-his-career>What Quentin Tarantino's Mother Really Thinks Of His Career</h2><p>Quentin said in The Momentwith Brian Koppelman that his mother once scolded him for doing his writing instead of his schoolwork. "In the middle of her little tirade, she said, 'Oh, and by the way, this little 'writing career' — with the finger quotes and everything — this little 'writing career' that you're doing? That s--- is f---ing over," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told Brian</a>. The Once Upon a Time in Hollywood director was deeply insulted by that remark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continued, "When she said that to me in that sarcastic way, I was in my head and I go: 'OK, lady, when I become a successful writer, you will never see penny one from my success, there will be no house for you. There's no vacation for you, no Elvis Cadillac for mommy. You get nothing. Because you said that." To this day, Quentin said he's never financially supported his mother. He only "helped her out with a jam with the IRS" once.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Uma Thurman Stopped Working With ‘Kill Bill’ Director Quentin Tarantino</a></span></p><p>The podcast host tried to change Quentin's view on the matter, saying that his mom's words at least "drove him" to success. But according to the Oscar winner, "There are consequences for your words as you deal with your children. Remember there are consequences for your sarcastic tone about what's meaningful to them." Maybe that's not such a bad thing to stand for. However, Quentin's mother said the story went "viral without full context."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Regarding my son Quentin – I support him, I'm proud of him and love him and his growing new family," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Connie told USA Today</a>. "It gave me great joy to dance at his wedding and receive his news upon the birth of my Grandson Leo." She added that she "does not wish to participate in this salacious transactional media frenzy." Obviously, Connie and Quentin are on good terms. The Pulp Fiction director just has his personal principles.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Messed Up Thing Quentin Tarantino Did To Diane Kruger In 'Inglourious Basterds'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuvdSepa2hnmLBor7Ap6uipp%2Boeq67zGaYp5xdrLWiwIydpp6rXai1pnnDqGY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./fans-are-shocked-that-marvel-comicbook-writers-are-underpaid-despite-mcu-success.html>&#171;&nbsp;Fans Are Shocked That Marvel Comicbook Writers Are Underpaid, Despite MCU Success</a>
