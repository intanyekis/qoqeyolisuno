celebrities like <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Scarlett Johansson</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Liz Gillies</a> tying the knot during the global pandemic,&nbsp;YouTuber Mr. Fruit's wedding ceremony&nbsp;probably takes the cake for being the cutest. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The ones who know Mr. Fruit, know him for his obviously quirky name, his playthroughs over a variety of games on his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube channel</a>, backed by his smooth voice articulating the witty and humorous narration.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Anyone familiar with the YouTube gaming sensation is bound to say that he doesn't play by the rules, and anything he does will be eccentric and cute, just like his online alias. Hence, conventionality was tossed out of the window during his wedding with&nbsp;girlfriend Claire&nbsp;Beck-Alper of&nbsp;over <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">five years</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>So what elements contributed to make Mr. Fruit's wedding an absolute delight? Here, we have all the insight!</p><h2>Mr. Fruit and Girlfriend Claire Got Married in August 2020</h2><p>In <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">episode 50</a> of GG over EZ podcast, Mr. Fruit <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> that he got married back on&nbsp;August 8, 2020. He had actually hinted about his wedding on August 7, 2020, by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeting</a>, "Tomorrow Ms. Fruit becomes Mrs. Fruit."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>With his regular podcast mates Rhabby and Blue in attendance, along with artist John Silva, Fruit shared that the wedding was low-key due to the pandemic, and this is where it gets interesting, as the newly married couple&nbsp;had&nbsp;their puppies posing as&nbsp;witnesses to their wedding vows. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the same podcast, the YouTuber also mentioned that although his real name isn't Fruit, his wife Claire was more than happy to&nbsp;take the name if he could legally change his last name to Fruit.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, he didn't do it as it wouldn't sit well with his parents. With a ride-or-die commitment like that, it makes sense he put a ring on it, even though it took him a few&nbsp;years.</p><h2>Mr. Fruit and Claire Have Been in a Relationship for over Five Years</h2><p>The proposal from Mr. Fruit came after dating Claire for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">five years</a>.&nbsp;He proposed to Claire back in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">July 2018,&nbsp;</a>and they had made their engagement official through an announcement on Instagram. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>On December 11, 2019, Mr. Fruit <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared </a>their engagement photos on Twitter along with their first-ever photo taken together.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Claire and I’s first photo together and our most recent (part of our engagement photos).

On August 15, 2015, Claire,&nbsp;who is good at making handmade posters, posted a photo of a gift sent by Mr. Fruit and referred to him as "bae," meaning they were already together for some time before that.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>They appeared in each other's social media timelines a few more times since then, remarkably in party photos and funny tweets. Their first <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">picture </a>together on Instagram was from Claire's graduation. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>One could see their budding relationship and the strength and togetherness they built through these adorable posts.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>My best friend.

On April 6, 2019, he even reduced his video content to one per day to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spend time</a> with Claire on her birthday.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><h2>Time Together as a Married Couple</h2><p>After getting hitched, Mr. and Mrs. Fruit have headed towards social duties&nbsp;as a married couple and have rarely continued with their regular appearances on each other's social media.</p><p>One of their post together as a married couple was on November 26, 2020, when they celebrated their first&nbsp;Thanksgiving together.
