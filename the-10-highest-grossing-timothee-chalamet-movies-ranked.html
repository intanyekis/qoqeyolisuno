In 2021 alone, he starred in three films that were all enormous box office successes, and he also landed some of the most highly sought-after upcoming roles in the industry. These roles include the part of young Willy Wonka in the next Willy Wonka reboot movie and the lead role of Paul Atreides in the Dune sequel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the release of a couple of his films during the epidemic and their restricted theatrical exposure, Chalamet is best renowned for his box office appeal and great versatility. What better time than after a spectacular 2022 to determine which of his shows were <a href=#>box office successes</a>? Let’s discover the 10 highest-grossing movies of Timothée Chalamet as of 2022.</p><h2 id=the-king-2019---255-936>The King (2019) - $255,936</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The King is a historical play about King Henry V succeeding his tyrant father, the tensions that enveloped the young king, and the victories that made him a more popular and effective ruler. Chalamet portrays King Henry V in the film, with Robert Pattinson, Lily-Rose Depp, and Joel Edgerton. Since The King had a restricted theatrical run prior to its debut on the streaming platform Netflix, its modest box office numbers are hardly unexpected. However, this does not mean that fans did not like the film, as many adored Pattinson and Chalamet's confrontation and character development.</p><h2 id=don-t-look-up-2021---1-5-million>Don't Look Up (2021) - $1.5 Million</h2><p>Don't Look Up is among the newest and most contentious films, as fans have been discussing the powerful social justice picture since its premiere last Christmas. The <a href=#>successful Christmas movie</a> depicts two eminent scientists attempting to persuade the U.S. government that the massive meteor they have just discovered will destroy the globe if early intervention is not undertaken. Although Chalamet's performance is more comic, the film's tone is far more serious as it invites the spectator to consider the present relationship between media and climate change. Don't Look Up is another Netflix movie that broke streaming site records yet had a limited theatrical run.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beautiful-boy-2018---16-6-million>Beautiful Boy (2018) - $16.6 Million</h2><p>Beautiful Boy is a coming-of-age movie based on a true tale of Nic Sheff (Timothée Chalamet) and his fight with managing and overcoming his addiction. Fans adored watching the dynamics play out on-screen since the film is both beautiful and painful. The film had a larger theatrical distribution than both The King and Don't Look Up before it was made available on a streaming service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Highest-Grossing Mark Ruffalo Films, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=a-rainy-day-in-new-york-2019---23-8-million>A Rainy Day In New York (2019) - $23.8 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chalamet and <a href=#>Elle Fanning</a> feature in A Rainy Day In New York, a comedic romance about a lovely couple who arrive in New York for the weekend and are faced with terrible weather and a sequence of mishaps. In addition to Selena Gomez, it featured Liev Schreiber and Jude Law. Due to a series of delays in its distribution, the picture did not have an extensive promotional campaign at the time of its debut, making it one of Chalamet's lesser-known movies.</p><h2 id=call-me-by-your-name-2017---41-9-million>Call Me By Your Name (2017) - $41.9 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Call Me By Your Name is a romantic story set in 1980s Italy about a 17-year-old kid who falls in love with an older research associate who is spending the summer with his family. Initially a modest independent picture, it performed much better than expected at the box office, breaking the record for 2017's "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Highest Per Theater Average Opener</a>." Chalamet was also nominated for an Oscar for "Best Actor in a Leading Role" despite the fact that the film's storyline was the subject of great debate.</p><h2 id=the-french-dispatch-2021---46-3-million>The French Dispatch (2021) - $46.3 Million</h2><p>Wes Anderson's newest work, The French Dispatch, is billed as a love letter to journalism. The movie takes place in a fictitious French city of the 20th century and brings to life several stories that journalists in the movie intend to publish in a magazine. Chalamet portrayed Zeffirelli, a revolutionary student whose lighthearted and thoughtful nature captivated the audience. Despite the film's popularity among Anderson aficionados, it did not garner a single Academy Award nomination.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 8 Highest-Grossing Zendaya Movies, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=lady-bird-2017---79-million>Lady Bird (2017) - $79 Million</h2><p>Lady Bird is a dramatic comedy about a 17-year-old with artistic interests growing up in Sacramento, California in the early 2000s. Chalamet, <a href=#>Saoirse Ronan</a>, and Laurie Metcalf deliver stunning performances in Greta Gerwig's directorial debut. Fans especially adored Ronan and Chalamet's chemistry. This is not one of Chalamet's greatest performances, but it is a picture for which he is well-known among fans, and the film performed significantly better than expected at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=little-women-2019---206-million>Little Women (2019) - $206 Million</h2><p>Little Women is Greta Gerwig's dramatic adaptation of the renowned novel of the same name by Louisa May Alcott. The narrative focuses on Jo March as she reflects on her life and relates the history of her sisters and family. Fans were excited to witness the newest version of the March sisters' narrative, especially since it was directed by Gerwig, and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">film's box office result reflected this expectation</a>. They also enjoyed witnessing the interaction between Chalamet's character Laurie and Florence Pugh's character Amy, since their chemistry was deemed remarkable.</p><h2 id=dune-2021---401-8-million>Dune (2021) - 401.8 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Denis Villeneuve adapted the classic science fiction novel Dune by Frank Herbert. Dune is an action-packed science fiction picture with a large tale and the raw material for a number of contemporary science fiction classics. In addition to Chalamet in the title role, the picture features Zendaya, Oscar Isaac, and Josh Brolin in a stellar cast. After the massive success of Villeneuve's Blade Runner sequel Blade Runner 2049, fans were eager to see what the director had in store for the adaptation. Dune was simultaneously released on HBO Max and was a tremendous box office hit.</p><h2 id=interstellar-2014---701-7-million>Interstellar (2014) - $701.7 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Christopher Nolan's <a href=#>science fiction film</a> Interstellar is about a group of scientists who go through a wormhole in space to help humanity live on an apocalyptic Earth. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain all deliver outstanding performances in the picture. Despite being one of Chalamet's minor roles, this is the highest-grossing picture he has ever been a part of. It is also worth mentioning that Chalamet nevertheless managed to make his screen presence felt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The Brains Behind MCU: Here's How Kevin Feige Built His $200 Million Empire</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Numbers</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gossip Chimp</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop Sugar</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMamdmoJmctaa%2F02aeq6ejqLavs4ytoKanpJ2ypnnCoZilmZ2awW65zq%2Bgnqtdp66vt8SdZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./vraylar-commercial-actress.html>&#171;&nbsp;Vraylar Commercial Actress</a>
