While we aren't calling all rappers liars, these are ten stars who have been caught red-handed lying in their songs.</p><h2 id=tyga><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Tyga</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tyga released his debut album, No Introduction, in 2008 in the hopes of taking the music scene by storm. However, he ended up defying the title of the album, giving a detailed explanation of how he grew up in the West Coast area of Compton. He painted a ghetto childhood, a pretty common theme with rappers. Unfortunately, the truth of his childhood was exposed when a clip of him on the show Bustas revealed that he actually grew up in San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles, with well-to-do parents. In fact, his parents had a Range Rover, yikes!</p><h2 id=slim-jesus><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Slim Jesus</span></h2><p>Rapper Slim Jesus rose to fame with his viral hit "Drill Time." The Ohio native talked about living like a thug for most of his childhood and being involved in several criminal activities. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A part of the lyrics read</a>:</p><p>"You can find me posted up on Frank block with my f* ckin' gang. You ain't really 'bout sh*t, stay out my spot, don't speak my name. Or I pull up on your block at night, wearing all black, and let that 40 bang."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The music video further amplified the tough street guy image. But it turned out that Slim Jesus, whose real name is Robert Church ― the name sure gives him away ― was nothing like he portrayed. The 24-year-old later confessed that it was all an act and came under serious fire for his lies.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here Are The Most Successful Rapper-Owned Clothing Lines</a></span></p><h2 id=lil-wayne><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lil Wayne</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As one of the OG's of the rap music industry, it's hard to imagine the hardcore Lil Wayne tell a lie in any of his songs. But it seems the Young Money CEO isn't all that he sings about. After the hit track "Versus"&nbsp;on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay-Z</a>'s 2013 album Magna Carta Holy Grail dissed rappers for lying about their net worth in songs, some dirty details were dug up about Lil Wayne. It turns out that in Wayne's 2011 hit track "Ballin," he claimed that he made $100 million when in fact, he made just $20 million. As of 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lil Wayne has an estimated net worth of $150 million</a>. Where did the $100 million go?</p><h2 id=future><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Future</span></h2><p>The majority of Future's identity as a rapper revolves around his flair for drugs. Several of his albums and mixtapes brag about his experience with all kinds of recreational drugs. The chorus of his hit song "Mask Off" mentions two drugs that are quite famous for their euphoria-inducing abilities. However, the favorite drug-addicted rapper isn't that into drugs. In a 2016 interview, Future confessed that he doesn't do a lot of drugs but sings about it because it is a number one seller.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">14 Rappers That Almost Threw Down With Sports Superstars</a></span></p><h2 id=desiigner><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Desiigner</span></h2><p>The world got proper exposure to Desiigner's rapping talent in his hit 2015 track, Panda. The catchy opening line that reads, "I got broads in Atlanta, Twistin' dope, lean, and the Fanta," is one that instantly sticks to the tip of the songs and is incredibly hard to forget. However, it seems the one-liner that endeared Desiigner is nothing but a lie. The Brooklyn confessed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview with Billboard</a>, saying, "I've never been to Atlanta." The truth is that a girl he met over Facebook was from the famous city, and she inspired the lyrics. He explained, "She just said she was from ATL, so I was like, 'All right -- I got broads in Atlanta."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cardi-b><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Cardi B</span></h2><p>Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's "WAP" changed the game when it was released in 2020 amid the pandemic. It soon became the national anthem all over social media, featuring in several TikTok videos. However, it was one line from Cardi B's first verse that sent the world spiraling ― "I don't cook, I don't clean. But let me tell you how I got this ring." Although Cardi raps about not needing to do chores in her home, her husband Offset ratted her out. In a hilarious clip posted on Offset's Instagram, Cardi can be seen sweeping their home as he accuses her of lying in the background.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=birdman><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Birdman</span></h2><p>It is not rare for rappers to brag about being involved with the latest investment opportunities and making ultimate money moves with mouth-watering deals, but Birdman took his claims to a whole new level. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In his song "#1 Stunna," the Cash Money Records CEO claimed</a>:</p><p>"I'm tryin' to put platinum eyebrows on these hoes. I Just bought me a platinum football field n*gga, you understand?"</p><p>It seems Birdman was speaking futuristically at the time. In an October 2010 interview, the record executive explicitly claimed he was in talks with the management of the Miami Dolphins to become a part-time owner. However, a report from the Miami Herald countered his claims noting that the football team's majority owner Stephen Ross said he had never spoken to Bridman about such a deal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wiz-khalifa><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Wiz Khalifa</span></h2><p>Wiz Khalifa's music is often about his undying love for weed. However, sometimes, the Minot rapper steps outside his scope to brag about women, fame, cars, and of course, money. As part of an investigation into Jay-Z's controversial lyrics about rappers who lie about their net worth, it was discovered that Wiz Khalifa made a false claim in one of his tracks. In his 2012 song, "Rowland," the rapper claims, "I'm talking vacation out and resorting, I made eleven million without any endorsements." However, Wiz Khalifa only earned $9 million that year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=plies><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Plies</span></h2><p>Plies dominated the rap scene in the late 2000s with hit songs like Shawty, Hypnotized, and I Am the Club. The Florida native sold himself as the ultimate gangsta who was in and out of jail for most of his life, garnering love from many. In his 2007 track "Runnin' My Momma Crazy," he even recalled sitting alone in a cold cell. However, upon looking at his criminal history, nothing was found. Plies got his first arrest at 29 years old, well after his rap career started, and it was a misdemeanor for resisting an officer without violence.</p><h2 id=diddy><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Diddy</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a whopping net worth of $900 million</a> as of 2021 and recognition as one of the wealthiest rappers, it is doubtful to think Diddy would lie about his net worth. Well before attaining his almost-billionaire status, the renowned rapper was already claiming to be worth a billion dollars. In the 2013 track "Shot Caller Remix," Diddy said, "Dippin' in the 'gatti, billboards in Tokyo. Worth about a billion and still run the city." At the time, Diddy was estimated to be worth only $580 million, so it's confusing why he was reaching so bad.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best Freestyle Rappers (Who Aren't Eminem)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipmqigmr%2B0edahpmavlaeybq%2FArp6hrF2auqOxy6WgrKCZo7RuwMeeZK2qpam1brXNZquhnZmnerS7zaCqaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./sara-evans-ex-jay-barker-on-probation-after-alleged-car-incident.html>&#171;&nbsp;Sara Evans Ex Jay Barker on Probation After Alleged Car Incident</a>
