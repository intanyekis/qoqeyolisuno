That's especially true given the reach of the podcast. However, given the nature of the episode, fans felt as though John Cena and Zac Efron weren't ready for such an interview. Bobby Lee basically took up most of the conversation, while the likes of Jermaine Fowler barely said anything.</p><p>Once he finally asked a question to John Cena and Zac Efron, let's just say they fell short of expectations. Bobby Lee asked Cena how his mom was. While Efron was asked out by Lee. Credit to Cena and Efron who were complete sports during the interview, and settled in nicely despite the different atmosphere. Still, despite their easygoing nature, fans felt as though they regretted the podcast.</p><p><strong>The most liked comments with thousands of likes read, "John and Zac both awkwardly smiling regretting coming on the show within minutes."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Another fan wrote, "Cena passing the mic away at every opportunity is priceless."

[Laughs] The physical preparation and the training, that’s something that I’ve always found very interesting. I’ve always admired people’s transformations, in particular for movie roles. I just find that dedication fascinating and special when I see it."</p><p>He continues, "So in training for this, I got to train essentially for my championship, my belt match. It all came down to, how precise is my training? Ho dedicated am I to this? How hard can I push? I think I shed a skin somewhere in those seven months where Kevin was really at the wheel. It felt honest, it felt real. I felt mentally there, as a direct result of the training."</p><p>At least from a fan perspective, both films were massive hits for Efron, adding to his impressive resume.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKCeYrCmusBmsZqbXZqzs7vNZqmen6KawbWxw2aZnqukYrOztcSnm6xloKSxpK3SrWY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./honey-boo-boo-child-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Honey Boo Boo Child Net Worth</a>
