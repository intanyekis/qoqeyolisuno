However, Mora has denied these allegations. He told the , "A complete fabrication... I doubt Najee ever said it because it never happened." The story, according to Mora, was entirely false.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>Cassidy, the source of the story, mentioned that Harris had shared this information during a camp at Fullerton College in 2016, a year before he began his college football career at Alabama. Cassidy described Harris' response as a "non-answer" that “was a throwaway comment in a larger conversation."</p><p>The Tupac Shakur murder case resurfaced in 2022 when Duane “Keffe D” Davis was charged with murder, nearly 27 years after Shakur's tragic death in a drive-by shooting.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>Davis, a former gang leader, had previously admitted his involvement in the murder to the police back in 2009, as part of a proffer agreement.
