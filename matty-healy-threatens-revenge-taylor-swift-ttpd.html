The songs weren't exactly kind, as she talked about a toxic relationship, and while <a href=#>Matty Healy has mostly kept quiet about the album</a>, sources now claim he's actually very angry and planning on taking revenge with the next The 1975 album.</p><p><strong>"Matty is currently keeping a low profile working on The 1975’s next album," an insider said to The Sun. "This time last week he had no idea he was about to become one of the most talked about men on the planet. He has opted to keep silent, but no NDA has been signed."</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The source then issued a warning</a>, saying that Taylor should expect Matty to slam her in retaliation for the tracks dedicated to him.</p><p>"Like Taylor, he uses his music as a form of release and storytelling. [The new album has] naturally caused him to think about their time together and he’s never been one to hold back when speaking his mind."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Also like Taylor, he’s moved on and is very happy with his current relationship with Gabbriette Bechtel," the insider felt compelled to add, <strong>"But there is nothing stopping him from writing about his romance with Taylor and having his say on what she said about him. Fans of the band should be keeping an eye out when that album drops."</strong></p><h2 id=taylor-swift-39-s-diss-track-about-matty-healy>Taylor Swift's Diss Track About Matty Healy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-the-tortured-poets-department.png><p>Taylor Swift's romance with Matty Healy didn't last long, but it received a lot of media attention, as it followed her breakup with Joe Alwyn.
