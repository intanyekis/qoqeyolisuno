He played third base and right field, was an audacious base runner, had a lifetime batting average just below .300 and played with such reckless abandon that scribes gave him a nickname: Wild horse.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Martin, born Feb. 29, 1904, played his final game in 1944, which would not make him all that relevant to the <a href=#>New York Mets</a> — who would not exist for another 16 years — except for one thing: Through the miracle of Baseball-Reference and math, we can see that Martin is the seventh-most similar batter (through the age-29 season) to the <a href=#>Mets</a>’ <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jeff McNeil</a>, another versatile contact hitter with a fearless playing style and fantastic nickname.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>That would be the stuff of trivia questions, of course, but a closer inspection at the other players on the list reveals an interesting trend: McNeil is such a throwback in style and such an outlier in career arc — few players debut at age 26 and grow into great players — that four other men on the list were born in the 1890s and early 1900s. McNeil, in other words, is such a unique baseball force — blending contact, hustle and premium defense in the infield and outfield – that it is as if he was dropped in from a previous era.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>“He’s such a versatile hitter,” <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mets</a> manager Buck Showalter said, “you could do about anything with him.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The subtle genius of Jeff McNeil has been on display once again as the Mets, 28-15, have built an eight-game lead in the NL East. He is batting .306 with one of the lowest strikeout rates in baseball. He is making plays at second base and in left field. In a series win in Colorado this past weekend, he had a multi-hit game on Saturday and another double in a victory on Sunday.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>McNeil is so adroit with the bat that Showalter compares him to 1) a point guard surveying the defense and looking for holes; and 2) Wade Boggs. (The latter because the angle of McNeil’s bat can create interesting spin.) He chokes up and makes contact to all fields. He delivers with runners in scoring position. He has been so consistent that he has mostly squashed the concerns that bubbled up after a relatively disappointing season in 2021. Or, as teammate <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mark Canha</a> puts it:<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>“If you hit over .300, you raked. It’s hard to do. It can’t be overlooked.”</p><p>So let’s take a moment to consider McNeil, one of the current masters of hitting .300. Just seven players in all of baseball have carried a .300 average across the last five seasons. McNeil — one of the seven – enters Monday with his career average right at .300. In a modern era of launch angle and rising strikeouts and expected batting average metrics, McNeil is something else, a connoisseur of contact who has finally learned to stop worrying about exit velocity and love the well-placed single. <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>“I think when people talk about average isn’t valued so much anymore, it’s kind of just another way of saying it’s hard to hit .300,” Canha says. “There’s not as many people that do it, so we have to look elsewhere for value.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>“It should be valued. Especially if the other numbers are paying off as well. Which Jeff walks and slugs, too, a little bit.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Highest batting average since the start of 2018&nbsp;</strong></p><table class="table table-condensed table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td valign=middle>Player</td><td valign=middle>Batting average</td><td valign=middle>wRC+</td></tr><tr><td valign=middle>Michael Brantley</td><td valign=middle>.308</td><td valign=middle>128</td></tr><tr><td valign=middle><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Freddie Freeman</a></td><td valign=middle>.306</td><td valign=middle>142</td></tr><tr><td valign=middle><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mike Trout</a></td><td valign=middle>.302</td><td valign=middle>183</td></tr><tr><td valign=middle>Xander Bogaerts<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></td><td valign=middle>.301</td><td valign=middle>136</td></tr><tr><td valign=middle>Trea Turner<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></td><td valign=middle>.301</td><td valign=middle>125</td></tr><tr><td valign=middle>Jeff McNeil</td><td valign=middle>.300</td><td valign=middle>126</td></tr><tr><td valign=middle><a class=ath_autolink href=#>Tim Anderson</a></td><td valign=middle>.300</td><td valign=middle>117</td></tr></tbody></table><p>(minimum 1,500 plate appearances)</p><p>It’s possible, of course, that baseball is cycling back toward what Jeff McNeil brings. In 2014, just 14 players batted .300 — the lowest since the turn of the last century. For comparison: Fifteen years ago, 40 players topped the .300 mark, and while that’s just one metric among many, it offers a shorthand view of a game that has become plagued by strikeouts and dominated by defensive shifts that siphon off singles.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Beginning next season, teams will no longer be allowed to have more than two infielders on one side of second base. On the one hand, the change could increase the value of contact. On the other, McNeil is the type of hitter who can beat any defense. In any case, Showalter believes that baseball is already starting to take a closer look at batting average.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>“I think you’re gonna see that increase some,” he said, speaking of the value of skill sets like McNeil’s. “Especially when some of the shifts go away. It’s gonna be a little different. I think people are starting to take a glance at batting average a little bit more.”</p><p>For now, McNeil remains a player who is equal parts valuable and entertaining, a flying squirrel who creates action, a hitter who, more often than not, has seemed to be in the middle of victories. Since 2018, the only players who have been better at avoiding strikeouts are <a class=ath_autolink href=#>David Fletcher</a>, Andrelton Simmons, Michael Brantley, Yuli Gurriel and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Wilmer Flores</a>. In 2022, McNeil has embraced this approach and style. If there are runners on base, he has a simple strategy: “I’m just trying to hit a line drive up the middle,” he said. If there is nobody on, he simplifies it even more.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><i>Hit it where they’re not.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></i></p><p>It’s a style, of course, that can work in any era.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>THE EXPOSITION<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p>“Let’s play two.” — Ernie Banks<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>“Baseball is 90 percent mental; the other half is physical.” — Yogi Berra<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>“Just don’t lose two in a row.” — The 2022 New York Mets<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>OK, to my knowledge, nobody on this year’s Mets team has uttered those words exactly. But the club is adhering to a simple formula: They win games. They win series. They lose some. Every team does. But they almost never lose two in a row.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>The trend continued Sunday in Colorado, where Taijuan Walker became the first pitcher this season to throw at least seven shutout innings at Coors Field. The Mets — see if you can follow me here — won their 14th straight game after a loss.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>“It’s a pretty steady mental team,” Showalter said.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>The competition will tick upward on Monday as the road trip continues in San Francisco.
