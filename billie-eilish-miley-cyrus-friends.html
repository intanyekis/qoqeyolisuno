While Miley has been in the spotlight for 15 years due to rising to fame on the Disney Channel, Billie rose to prominence during the past decade and her fame skyrocketed in 2019 with the release of her debut studio album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Many Tattoos Does Miley Cyrus Have And What Do They Mean?</a></span></p><p>Today, we're taking a look at whether the two ladies are actually friends in real life. It's no secret that everyone knows everyone in Hollywood — but that doesn't mean that everyone is actually best friends. If you're wondering just how the two ladies know each other and whether they actually like each other's music, then keep on scrolling to find out!</p><h2 id=let-39-s-start-off-with-the-fact-that-both-musicians-rose-to-fame-at-a-young-age><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Let's Start Off With The Fact That Both Musicians Rose To Fame At A Young Age</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let's start off with the fact that both Miley Cyrus and Billie Eilish rose to fame at a young age — which is certainly something the two can bond over. Thanks to the Disney Channel show Hannah Montana, Miley Cyrus rose to in 2006 when she was only 13 years old — and she has been in the spotlight ever since. Billie Eilish rose to fame in 2015 with her debut single "Ocean Eyes" and at the time she was 14 years old. While Miley is nine years older than Billie, the two certainly have plenty of similar experiences to talk about and Miley is surely somewhat of a role model for Billie, meaning that she can give her great advice.</p><h2 id=and-the-two-have-crossed-paths-at-numerous-industry-events><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>And The Two Have Crossed Paths At Numerous Industry Events</span></h2><p>Since both musicians are very successful, it doesn't come as a surprise that their paths frequently cross. Both Miley Cyrus and Billie Eilish are often invited to the most important events in the industry — and recently the two have been spotted together at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art gala which was hosted by Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio and LACMA trustee Eva Chow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Billie Eilish Addresses Rumors Of A Rivalry With Olivia Rodrigo</a></span></p><p>At the event, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus and Billie Eilish were seen hanging out with model Hailey Bieber</a>, and it certainly seemed as if all three ladies had a great time together.</p><h2 id=billie-eilish-is-friends-with-miley-cyrus-39-younger-sister-noah><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Billie Eilish Is Friends With Miley Cyrus' Younger Sister Noah</span></h2><p>Billie Eilish is certainly no stranger to the Cyrus family as <a href=#>she's been friends with Noah Cyrus for quite some time</a>. Noah — who is Miley Cyrus' younger sister — is only two years older than Billie which certainly contributed to the fact that the two ladies bonded over the years. Besides that, Noah is also a talented musician so the two have another thing in common. However, the two tend to keep their relationship private which is why many may not be aware of their friendship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-even-covered-billie-39-s-song-39-my-future-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Miley Even Covered Billie's Song 'My Future'</span></h2><p>While the two ladies know each other personally, it also seems as if they're big fans of each other's music. During a BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge in 2020, Miley Cyrus performed a cover of Billie Eilish's hit "My Future." Miley put her own spin on the song, but there is no doubt that the former Disney Channel star is a huge fan of Billie's music.</p><h2 id=after-which-billie-sent-a-thank-you-gift-to-miley><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>After Which Billie Sent A Thank-You Gift To Miley</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, having seen that Miley Cyrus covered one of her own songs certainly must have felt surreal for Billie Eilish. After seeing the performance, Billie sent <a href=#>a beautiful bouquet of flowers with a sweet note to Miley</a>, which the former Disney Channel star shared on her social media.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Taylor Swift And Miley Cyrus Actually Friends?</a></span></p><p>In the note, Billie wrote that she hopes the two can meet once the pandemic calms down. Today, we know that two have met at industry events — and there is no doubt they will cross paths some more.</p><h2 id=miley-revealed-that-she-would-love-to-collaborate-with-billie-eilish><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Miley Revealed That She Would Love To Collaborate With Billie Eilish</span></h2><p>While the two have met and are clearly fans of each other — there is no doubt that the world would love to see these two artists collaborate on music. In a recent interview with the British Vogue magazine, Miley Cyrus was asked whom she would love to collaborate next, and this was her answer:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There are always new emerging artists that are super interesting. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I love Billie Eilish.

From fangirling over each other's music to crossing paths at industry events — it's clear that the two are on good terms and hopefully, fans will even get to see them collaborate in the future. Until then, we'll have to look for clues about their friendship on their social media, where they often interact with each other!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Billie Eilish's Most Impressive Guinness World Records</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZoqScnrJusciloKygXaK2rbHYZpqyqqWoeqe%2ByJ6lnatf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ashley-stock-biography.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ashley Stock Bio (Wiki)</a>
