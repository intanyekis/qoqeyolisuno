It is a very common practice for fans to be inquisitive about those that are related to a celebrity.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Dominic_Fike></span>Who is Dominic Fike?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dominic David Fike (born December 30, 1995) is a singer, songwriter, and actor from the United States. Fike rose to prominence after uploading several popular songs to the website SoundCloud. Dominic Fike is of African-American, Filipino, and Haitian descent and grew up with a younger brother, Alex, a sister, Apollonia (Apple), and an older brother, Sean. Fike graduated from Estero High School in 2014.</p><p>Fike liked Jack Johnson, Blink-182 and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. He first picked up a guitar at the age of ten and began learning to play songs by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.</p><p>He signed with Columbia Records after the release of his debut extended play, Don’t Forget About Me, Demos. Fike’s song “3 Nights” charted in multiple countries. Later, he worked with the band Brockhampton and the singer Halsey. Fike’s single “Chicken Tenders” was released in June 2020.</p><p>He released the single “Politics & Violence” in July of the same year. The same month, Fike’s debut album, What Could Possibly Go Wrong, was released. Several countries, including the United States and Australia, charted the album in the top 50.</p><p>Fike will be the headliner for a concert series in the video game Fortnite in September 2020. Fike was named one of the NME’s essential new artists for 2020 a few months later. He covered Paul McCartney’s “The Kiss of Venus” for his album McCartney III Imagined.</p><p>In 2022, Fike joined the cast of Euphoria’s second season as Elliot, his first major acting role.</p><p>Fike recalled that as a child, he and his brothers had to look after each other because his parents were frequently absent from his life. Fike’s mother was in and out of jail throughout his childhood, causing him to stay in various homes, including those of his older brother, relatives, or his parents’ friends.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Background></span>Background<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fike’s childhood was “full of adventure,” as he and his friends spent time in the “Forest of Avalon,” a forested area near their neighborhood where they ate snacks and smoked cannabis. He and his older brother Sean would also hang out at his friend Stefan’s guest house, known as the “Backhouse,” where they would freestyle.</p><p>Later, they formed a formal rap collective with members Slyte, Ike Lysergic, and Seno. They gained a following in the community, and Fike formed a sub-group known as Lame Boys ENT. In 2015, the group began to gain attention from the local media and was booked for music festivals.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fike started uploading songs on the Internet in high school and the first song he uploaded on YouTube was a song called “Not A Word”. He also taped songs he had recorded. Fike briefly enrolled in college but dropped out after only three days.</p><p>Fike rose to prominence by producing beats with his then-producer, Hunter Pfeiffer (aka 54), which resulted in the release of numerous successful SoundCloud tracks. While on house arrest for assault on a police officer, he released the EP Don’t Forget About Me, Demos as an independent artist in December 2017 at the age of 21. He was eventually arrested and taken to the Collier County Jail for violating his home arrest.</p><p>A bidding war ensued after the EP piqued the interest of numerous record labels. He signed with Columbia in August for a reported $4 million after being released in April 2018. All of his previous work, including the EP, was removed from all streaming sites during the bidding war. Fike stated that the main reason he wanted to work for a record label was to pay for his mother’s lawyer fees, who was facing drug charges at the time.</p><p>The EP was reissued by Columbia on October 16, 2018. The single “3 Nights” was released the same year. The single was well-received and reached the top ten of the charts in Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Its acoustic guitar tone has been compared to songs by Jack Johnson. It was played on various radio stations and Spotify playlists, and it received favorable reviews from publications such as Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, and Billboard. In relation to the EP, Billboard labeled Fike as a “genre-mingling” artist, and later dubbed him a breakout performer to watch, calling “3 Nights” “Motown-tinged, trend-proof, and enticing.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=2019></span>2019<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In January 2019, Fike stated that he was working on an album.

On July 4, 2019, he released “Phone Numbers,” another single produced by Kenny Beats. The music video for this song was released on October 15, 2019. On July 9, 2019, Fike announced that he would be embarking on a Rain or Shine tour later this year.</p><p>The North American leg of the tour began on August 31 in Philadelphia and ended on October 3 in Los Angeles.
