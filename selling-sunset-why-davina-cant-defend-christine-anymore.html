At the end of season 5, the former was accused of bribing Emma Hernan's client to stop doing business with her. When asked about it, Potratz said that she "can't defend" Quinn anymore... Here's what really happened to their friendship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Selling Sunset': What Happened To Emma Hernan And Micah McDonald?</a></span></p><h2 id=christine-quinn-amp-davina-potratz-used-to-be-close>Christine Quinn & Davina Potratz Used To Be Close</h2><p>In 2021, <a href=#>fans accused Quinn of faking her pregnancy</a> after the glamorous portrayal of her maternal journey in season 4. At that time, she was also dealing with <a href=#>her drama-turned-legal dispute with Chrishell Stause</a>. Potratz stood by the How to be a Boss B---h through it all. "Christine was absolutely pregnant. I saw her belly. She called me from the hospital the day she gave birth. I saw her C-section scar," she told Not Skinny but Not Fat podcast in January 2022. "We were on FaceTime. She absolutely was pregnant and gave birth to her son. Why should someone hate her because [of] that? That's not fair. It's really hurtful, you know, when someone says she didn't give birth."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I can't lie about something that I don't know about, but I will defend something that I do know," she continued. "She really was pregnant and that she really did give birth to her child. Regardless of people supporting her or not supporting her, that part of it is true." As of season 4, Quinn was also close to Amanza Smith and Vanessa Villela who paid her a visit after giving birth to her first child, Christian "Baby C" Georges Dumontet. The new mother even opened up to them about her tough emergency C-section. But in season 5, it seemed like Villela and Quinn had drifted apart. <a href=#>Smith also had a spat with the latter during a broker's open</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Selling Sunset': Why Chrishell Stause And Jason Oppenheim Didn't Film Their Breakup</a></span></p><h2 id=why-davina-potratz-39-can-39-t-defend-39-christine-quinn-anymore>Why Davina Potratz 'Can't Defend' Christine Quinn Anymore</h2><p>In an interview with Us Weekly in April 2022, Potratz said that she "can't defend" Quinn anymore after allegations of her bribing Hernan's client. "I truly care about Christine. So I'm sitting here trying to defend her actions to people and be sympathetic and empathetic to whatever she's going through," said the realtor. "But it's like, she doesn't appreciate it. At some point, I would never hurt anyone, but I have to just then stay out of it because I don’t know what's going on." She added that the issue didn't come up at the O Group for "a long time."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was so confused and I was like, 'What is happening? Why is this happening? Do we have all of the information? Because this surely can't be the case.' But I wasn't there," Potratz shared. "I don't know what happened. It's just very sad and heartbreaking to hear that this is even out there. I just am very disappointed and that's really all I can say. It's very low and I wish she wouldn't be caught up in something like that." The real estate agent also said that she didn't know "what the status" was when the new season premiered. "I'm curious as well. I honestly don't know because it's wild," Potratz said of Quinn's fate in the O Group. "Unless there's a very, very good explanation of why this might have happened — I just don't understand."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Selling Sunset': Who Is Chelsea Lazkani's Husband Jeff Lazkani?</a></span></p><h2 id=are-christine-quinn-amp-davina-potratz-still-friends>Are Christine Quinn & Davina Potratz Still Friends?</h2><p>Potratz also told Us Weekly that she still cares about Quinn despite her mean comments about her in season 5. "It was honestly heartbreaking and just very disappointing. I really care about her as a person and I know she knows that, so I was kind of shocked to see how she talked about me and I couldn't believe it," said Potratz. But a few days after that interview, she told Behind the Velvet Rope with David Yontef that she's done with Quinn. "Unfortunately for her, she's pretty much, ruptured every relationship she has at this brokerage," said Potratz. "So I didn't do anything to her. I defended her. And when I finally couldn't anymore, because all she did was speak negatively behind my back. So the most respectful thing I could do is not say anything."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"And she still kept going on and on. I mean, all she does is talk about me. I barely even mentioned her," the realtor continued. "So it's like, to me, why are you projecting how you feel inside? Are you jealous that I'm not hated? Like, I don't know how else to take it, to be honest." Potratz was particularly offended by Quinn's comments about her broker's license. "And so then she makes fun of me on the show," she shared. "I'm just like, this is like ridiculous. But again, it's, it says a lot more about her."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>'Selling Sunset': Who Is Vanessa Villela's Fiancé Tom Fraud?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnqScnruoedKupaydpGLEqcWMnZivoZ6WeqStza1knZ2WmrulecKhqaKrpJ67pnnAp7Cmp6KafA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./sherpa-winter-fashion-finds-amazon.html>&#171;&nbsp;Cozy Sherpa Fashion Finds To Upgrade Your Winter Wardrobe</a>
