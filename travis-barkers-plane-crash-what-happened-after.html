He knew that if he wanted to thrive, not just survive after what happened, he needed to start embracing a healthy lifestyle. Nearly 15 years after the crash, Barker is running three miles a day, starting his mornings with a cup of matcha, and <a href=#>enjoying the sweeter sides of life like panchakarma cleanses with his now-wife Kourtney Kardashian</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>11 Lesser Known Facts About Blink-182's Drummer, Travis Barker</a></span></p><p>Some may consider his healthy transformations extreme, but Travis credits his new way of life with not only saving him but helping him feel even better than he did before the crash. What exactly has Travis been doing to ensure he lives a healthy life?</p><h2 id=travis-barker-credits-the-plane-crash-for-his-sobriety>Travis Barker Credits The Plane Crash For His Sobriety</h2><p>Travis Barker admits that who he was 14 years ago is a complete anomaly compared to the type of person he has grown to become. While he still loves a good party, his days of chugging back drinks, taking party dr*gs, and living a rock star's life to the fullest had to be retired. He's been sober from hard dr*gs and alcohol for eight years, and from marijuana for almost five years now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Travis woke up from the crash, 65% of his body was covered in third-degree burns. After a three-month stay at a hospital in Georgia, where he endured 26 surgeries and was constantly pumping himself full of morphine, Travis went home to start recuperating. On his first day home from the hospital, he decided to flush all the pain medication he’d been given, as he knew he’d continue to ab*se it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Musicians Who Survived Terrifying Plane Accidents</a></span></p><p>During an interview with men's health, Travis talked about how people asked if the drummer had ever gone to rehab. He credits his recovery from the plane crash with being his version of rehab, where he had no choice but to stop what he was doing to himself and suffer through the pain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Travis has been honest about his journey to sobriety, even sharing on Joe Rogan's podcast that he occasionally misses his vices. He'll even have dreams where he thinks he's still high and fears how he'll stop.</p><p>He knows he's strong enough to tackle those troubling thoughts, these days. His clearheadedness is with what makes life so much sweeter these days, as he's present in every moment. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Travis even felt comfortable enough to fly for the first time since his plane crash in August</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 2021</a>.</p><h2 id=why-travis-barker-is-vegan>Why Travis Barker Is Vegan</h2><p>Another lifestyle choice that Travis chose to embrace after his plane crash was veganism. The drummer credits the change in his diet with helping him feel better right away. He loves impossible sausages, meatless beef & broccoli from Erewhon, and he also tries to avoid gluten. He's also an avid plant-based protein powder fan, enjoying it in a smoothie at least once a day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Travis even convinced his wife to give the vegan lifestyle a try. <a href=#>Although Kourtney admittedly loves the keto diet</a>, since being with Travis the reality star opts to eat vegan food roughly 90% of the time. He also credits the diet with helping him enjoy exercising.</p><p>During an interview with Men's Health, Travis shared <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how his vegan diet has led to higher energy levels</a>, saying he has to force himself to sleep at the end of the day.</p><h2 id=how-travis-barker-39-s-new-lifestyle-has-changed-his-family-life>How Travis Barker's New Lifestyle Has Changed His Family Life</h2><p>Travis actually enjoys working out so much that he does it nearly every day now. Before his accident, the drummer was sleeping until the late afternoon, so he could stay up all night drinking and smoking. Now the rock star likes to get to bed early so he and his wife can hit the gym together first thing in the morning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Tom Holland Shocks Fans With Aggressive Workout Video</a></span></p><p>His workout routines vary throughout the week and depending on where he is in the world. He switches from boxing, to muay Thai, he even adds breath work to his weekly workout routines.</p><p>Travis does try to run at least 5 times a week, clocking in at a cool 6 or 7 miles per hour of running. He'll save his rest day for a Saturday or Sunday, where even then he might partake in Pilates or squeeze in a run. He's learned to use exercise as a way to center himself within his body, without it, he feels off.</p><p>Through all the trials and tribulations that Travis has endured since his plane crash, he's only come out stronger. He credits his sober mind and body with allowing him to be the best father, friend, and artist he can be. He's been able to open himself back up to love, <a href=#>marrying his longtime friend and confidant Kourtney Kardashian</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the support of his loved ones coupled with the healthy lifestyle he's crafted for himself and religiously follows, Travis Barker can truly do anything he puts his mind to.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBursCrop6qo2K9ra3NnmScqpGotW7Dx5qrZqCRpb2musSdZJqepJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./answer-these-10-questions-to-find-out-if-you-are-bad-in-bed.html>&#171;&nbsp;Answer These 10 Questions To Find Out If You Are Bad In Bed</a>
