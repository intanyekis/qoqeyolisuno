Together, they navigate heartache, tragedy, marriage, and ups and downs in their careers.

The Firefly Lane star also has an elder sister named <strong>Tiera Skovbye</strong> who is an actress and model known for her work in the Netflix series, Riverdale.</p><p>The 20-year-old star has been acting in Hollywood for a while; at the age of 4, she appeared in her first national car commercial. She finished her further education at King George High School, according to her Linkedin profile. She began working as a part-time hostess at Cactus Club Cafe in 2019 and did so for just three months.</p><p>In 2009, Ali Skovbye made her acting debut as Beth in the drama film Personal Effects. She appeared in several films and television shows between 2010 and 2016, including Adventures in Babysitting, One Christmas Wish, Falling Skies, Once Upon a Time, Wishing Well, Smallville, and others.

She participates in a variety of activities in addition to acting, one of which is karate.</p><p>As mentioned above, she plays the role of Tully Hart in the Netflix series. Tully is a natural force of nature—attractive, aspirational, careless, and utterly devoted. Even when she achieves incredible fame and money as a journalist and talk show presenter, she struggles with inner loneliness because she still carries the wounds of a difficult upbringing. And her best friend and soul mate Kate, with whom she has an unbreakable link, is her savior.</p><p>Talking about her personal life, Ali Skovbye is currently in a relationship with her boyfriend. Despite posting pictures of her boyfriend, including a kissing picture, we’re unaware of her who her boyfriend is as Ali does not mention anything about his identity.
