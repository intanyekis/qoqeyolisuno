In fact, she lost a lot of money in legal fees over the years, as well as spent cash on living expenses and security.</p><p>Some of her deals also fell through; Monica didn't complete her contract with Jenny Craig, leaving $700K on the table when she walked away.</p><p>Yet Go Banking Rates lists her bio today as "an American television personality, TV producer, fashion designer, author and activist," which isn't too bad of a resume, even if not every gig worked out.</p><p>Though Monica began her time in the spotlight as something of a joke in many circles, she blazed a path that allowed her to live life on her own terms and embrace only those opportunities that she chooses.</p><p>There might not be any way to escape the past, but Monica is shaping her own future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-has-monica-lewinsky-been>Where Has Monica Lewinsky Been?</h2><h3 id=monica-lewinsky-stepped-out-of-the-spotlight-for-nearly-a-decade-to-rebrand-herself>Monica Lewinsky stepped out of the spotlight for nearly a decade to rebrand herself</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/monica-lewinsky-in-an-interview.jpg><p>After the court proceedings, Monica Lewinsky almost disappeared from public view. Though she released a book and did an iconic interview with Barbara Walters, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">immunity she was granted</a> for testifying in court limited what she was able to speak about publicly.</p><p>At first, <strong>Monica had denied that she was ever involved with President Clinton</strong>, which could have resulted in perjury charges as she was, evidently, lying. But the immunity deal brought out the truth: Monica alleged that Clinton asked her to lie if she was ever questioned about the nature of their relationship.</p><p>For a while, Monica appeared in the public eye often; she hosted a reality TV dating show, much to critics' ire. Later, while she somewhat escaped the spotlight, Monica earned a graduate degree in London. But in 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she formally resurfaced with an essay in Vanity Fair</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the essay, Monica related an experience she had on a TV show where audience members asked her questions (there might have been a reason <a href=#>Bill Clinton opted out of a reality TV opportunity</a>). One smirking man asked an off-color comment about Monica's reputation for the Bill Clinton affair.</p><p>In mulling over how she responded, and how the comment made her feel later, Lewinsky wrote, "It may surprise you to learn that Iâm actually a person."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/monica-lewinsky-was-left-furious-over-her-interview-with-matt-lauer-and-it-caused-her-to-cancel-on-abc.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Monica Lewinsky Was Left Furious Over Her Interview With Matt Lauer And It Caused Her To Cancel On ABC</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Monica Lewinsky was praised for how she handled Matt Lauer during their groundbreaking interview on the Today Show.</span><p>Reflecting on how she was treated following the news of what Monica maintains was a relationship (and not solely under-the-Oval-office-desk, one-sided intimacy), Lewinsky said she was "arguably the most humiliated person in the world."</p><p>It was a tough path to travel, but ultimately, Monica did find some positives from it allâand she still writes for Vanity Fair now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-monica-do-for-a-living>What Does Monica Do For A Living?</h2><h3 id=monica-lewinsky-is-a-film-producer>Monica Lewinsky is a film producer</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/monica-lewinsky-2.jpg><p>Though the long-ago presidential scandal was embarrassing for Lewinsky, she was eventually able to monetize her story in multiple ways.</p><p>For one, she penned a book about her life (it's called Monica's Story), which <strong>earned her a $500,000 advance from her publisher</strong>. And that epic interview with Barbara Walters? <strong>Monica earned $1 million for it</strong>.</p><p>A few years after the scandal broke, Monica became an original influencer; her notoriety led to a spokeswoman role with Jenny Craig. But perhaps her most interesting gig is Monica's dive into movies and television.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an IMDb profile that lists plenty of appearances</a> as herself in interviews and specials, but also two production credits. Lewinsky produced 10 episodes of American Crime Story plus she executive produced the special 15 Minutes of Shame, a reflection on "public shaming in modern day culture."</p><p>In addition to producing, Monica has a handful of writing credits, tooâand, she has a line of designer handbags (The Real Monica Inc.). The handbag business, interestingly, grew from Monica's dedication to knitting, a hobby she once credited for getting her through the media firestorm of the late '90s.</p><h2></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecyopaKbkWK5psPIp6qksaNiu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./is-she-hulk-actor-trevor-salter-filipino-his-nationality-family-how-is-josh-miller-related-to-the-hulk-king-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is She Hulk Actor Trevor Salter Filipino?
