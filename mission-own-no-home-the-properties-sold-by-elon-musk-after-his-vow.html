He stood true to his promise when he put his seven homes on sale to find the right buyer.&nbsp;<a href=#>The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX</a> tweeted in May 2020 and announced that he would sell all his physical possessions. While the idea of living in no home seemed far-fetched, Elon Musk did what he said he would. Musk stated that he was more focused on creating sustainable energy and his <a href=#>ambitious SpaceX Projects</a>. One of the primary reasons Musk sold his properties was because he received a lot of scrutiny due to his $185 billion net worth and alleged tax evasion. While selling properties from his large real estate portfolio, Musk ensured that he sold it to the right people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From the first property he purchased in Bel Air to the quirky Gene Wilder house he owns, Elon Musk’s homes were some of the finest mansions in LA with sprawling views of the city. Let’s take a look at the seven properties Elon Musk sold while being on his ‘No Home’ quest since 2020.</p><h2 id=gene-wilder-s-house>Gene Wilder’s House</h2><p>In October 2020, <a href=#>Elon Musk reportedly sold</a> his Gene Wilder Bel-Air Mansion for $7 million. He had purchased the property in 2013 to preserve the legacy and spirit of Gene Wilder. Musk never resided in the house but used it as a private school for his children and some children from Tesla and SpaceX’s higher-level employees. While he had made clear announcements about selling all his properties, he made a specific request for the Gene Wilder house. He had tweeted that the house shouldn’t be torn down or lose its soul, to maintain the spirit of the legendary actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The story behind the sale is quite heartwarming and interesting. The estate was sold for $250,000 more than what Musk paid in 2013. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teslarati</a>, it is recorded that the new owner of the estate is a company whose sole owner is screenwriter and television producer Elizabeth Hunter. She had worked on shows like Empire and Charmed. She has lived in Los Angeles for a long time and is married to Jordan Walker-Pearlman, who is the nephew of Gene Wilder. As the price tag was massive, Musk himself lent $6.7 million, 95% of the amount, to the couple to purchase the house. The house is 2,800 sq. ft. and has five bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms. Additionally, the estate has a pool and private guest house.</p><h2 id=his-largest-bel-air-mansion>His Largest Bel Air Mansion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first property sold by <a href=#>Elon Musk</a> was his 20,000 sq. ft. Bel-Air Mansion for $29 million. The property was uploaded on Zillow with an asking price of $30 million but sold for a million less. Chinese tech billionaire William Ding purchased the house and paid $5.5 million more than what Musk had paid to purchase the property in 2016. It served as his primary residence, where he lived with his children. The gated and walled property comes with a state-of-the-art security system to ensure the safety and protection of the residents.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Elon Musk’s SpaceX Launches The First All-Civilian Flight To The Orbit</a></span></p><p>The house has seven bedrooms and eleven bathrooms, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>, with well-maintained gardens, a pool, and a spa. The house has a beautiful architectural structure that offers a sweeping view of the Bel-Air Country Club and Catalina Island. The multi-story house also has a four-car garage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-bel-air-packaged-deals>4 Bel Air Packaged Deals</h2><p>Hot on his selling spree, Elon Musk managed to sell four of his remaining Bel-Air properties as a $62 million package deal. Three of these are tucked closely together, while the fourth property is built directly under it. It was bought by Ardie Tavengarian, a spec developer who plans to combine the residential homes into a single project.</p><p><a href=#>The first mansion features</a> six bedrooms and five bathrooms in a 9,309 sq. ft. area with beautiful decks and patios located on the hillside. It was sold for $29.72 million. The second home is across the street and was built in the 1960s featuring old Colonial architecture. The two-story house is on a 3,943 sq. ft. of land and has five bedrooms and four bathrooms, sold for $6.77 million, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a>. Around the corner, the third property is a 2,963 sq. ft home sold for $4.43 million. It is the smallest on the list with four bedrooms and four bathrooms. The fourth home is tucked underneath that spans over 7,000 sq. ft with six bedrooms and eight bathrooms. Musk sold it for $21 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-precursor>The Precursor</h2><p>Before he announced his intentions to <a href=#>sell all his properties</a>, Elon Musk was already on the quest to sell his Brentwood property in 2019. The home was only twenty minutes away from his former six Bel-Air properties. The 3,000 sq. ft. mid-century modern home was sold for $4.49 million.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Market Watch</a>, the home is shaped like a boomerang with angular designs. The triangle-shaped lot has floor-to-ceiling windows and a curved hallway. Additionally, it comes with smart-tech features to maintain safety and privacy. The residence has a saltwater pool in the backyard, patio areas, and a lovely kitchen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elon Musk currently lives in a $50,000 tiny house in Boca Chica, Texas, near SpaceX’s base. The boxable home is only 400 sq. ft. but is equipped with all the essentials. He has sold almost all of his properties while one remains unsold, his Bay Area mansion. Musk wants to sell his last remaining home to a family because the place is close to his heart.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>6 Homes In The Jeff Bezos $500 Million Real Estate Collection</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teslarati</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Market Watch</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6qr%2FSoqanZZ%2Bsu266zmafqKWVYsGpsYypqaiolafBqrHSZqqopJRir7p5xKWmp2WdqsCsecCfq56qXZ22tHnVqK5o</p></div><div id=links><a href=./nicholas-luckinbill-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html>&#171;&nbsp;Nicholas Luckinbill Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</a>
