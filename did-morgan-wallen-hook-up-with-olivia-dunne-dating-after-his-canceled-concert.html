I really thought I'd be able to take the stage and it kills me to deliver this so close to showtime, but my voice is shot and I am unable to sing. All tickets will be refunded at point of purchase. I am so sorry, I promise you guys I tried everything I could."</p><p>Since Wallen told his fans on social media with not much notice, it's no wonder that they were surprised and wondering what was going on. It's definitely disappointing to show up at a venue and realize that a band or singer isn't going to be there after all.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Deeper Meaning Behind Morgan Wallen's Best Songs Reveal The Truth About His Troubled Life</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, while Wallen said that he had lost his voice, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">people wondered if the concert was canceled</a> because of something else.
