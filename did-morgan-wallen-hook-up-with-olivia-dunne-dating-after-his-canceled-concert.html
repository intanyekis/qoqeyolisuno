I really thought I'd be able to take the stage and it kills me to deliver this so close to showtime, but my voice is shot and I am unable to sing. All tickets will be refunded at point of purchase. I am so sorry, I promise you guys I tried everything I could."</p><p>Since Wallen told his fans on social media with not much notice, it's no wonder that they were surprised and wondering what was going on. It's definitely disappointing to show up at a venue and realize that a band or singer isn't going to be there after all.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Deeper Meaning Behind Morgan Wallen's Best Songs Reveal The Truth About His Troubled Life</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, while Wallen said that he had lost his voice, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">people wondered if the concert was canceled</a> because of something else. According to Billboard, a security guard said that he hadn't lost his voice after all. When a fan inquired about whether Wallen had been drinking and that was why he couldn't sing, the guard said yes.</p><p>Seth England, the CEO of Big Loud, posted a statement that Best Crowd Management had written.

The lawsuit said, "Even if ticket prices are refunded, no offer has been made to reimburse concertgoers for other out-of-pocket expenses they incurred in connection with the concert cancellation, including transportation, lodging, food, merchandise sales, transaction fees, and other such expenses."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the lawsuit didn't go very far at all, as federal court didn't allow it to go forward, the fan's lawyer, Casey Lott, gave an interview to The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal.
