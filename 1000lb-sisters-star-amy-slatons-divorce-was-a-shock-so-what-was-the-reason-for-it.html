As such, no one was arrested.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy later made an official complaint against Michael</a>, accusing him of becoming physically aggressive with their children. She said he was “hitting too hard” when disciplining the boys. “He pulls them by the arm,” Amy stated in court documents. “[Michael] throws things.

Magazine. "They have been fighting over this for months."</p><p>Additionally, the same source claimed that Amy was bothered by Michael’s lack of involvement with their kids, and that he appeared “jealous” most of her attention was on the boys.

And I'm like all you do is play video games," Amy said during a 2023 episode. "You can't pick up a room? It must be nice having a vacation. Now I have to clean up after Gage, Glenn and Michael. What the hell? I signed up for two kids."</p><p>Michael and Amy’s divorce is still ongoing, though they both seem eager at this point to end the marriage. There also remains the question of custody over their sons, though Michael retains only limited communication with the boys in supervised circumstances. Though fans will have to wait for future episodes, there’s no doubt that the former couple’s break-up will be discussed in detail on their TLC reality show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWhgoa9uv8isq56qo2LAta3RZpimsV2ouaLAzqeqZpyZq7yzr8RmrpqrXZZ6tLTOnKJmq59ixKmt02aumqtdqbWmedGemKynnmKzsL6Moqto</p></div><div id=links><a href=./audrina-patridge-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Audrina Patridge Net Worth</a>
