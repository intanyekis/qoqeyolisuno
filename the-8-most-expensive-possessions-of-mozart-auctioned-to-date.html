Amadeus Mozart was an exceptional and prolific composer of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Classical period</a>. There’s hardly a single soul who has not heard of the legendary Mozart. Although his talented life was short-lived, the impact of his work is still affecting young souls to this day. His short yet rapid pace of blissful composition resulted in more than 800 different works of almost every genre of the 1700s.</p><p>Mozart was one of the most influential composers and was responsible for famous and loved pieces such as chamber, operatic, symphonic, and choral music. Legends like Mozart are only born once in a blue moon, and Mozart came to life in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Salzburg, home to a musical family</a>.</p><p>From a young age, Mozart’s family could tell that he was a musical prodigy. When he turned 5, he could read and even write music and would often entertain guests by playing on the keyboard for them. At age 6, he started writing his first-ever compositions. All this success was well-deserved because everyone thought of Mozart as a rate musical genius.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mozart’s parents recognized his talents early on and encouraged him to pursue his interests in music.

Thus, later in Italy, Mozart was commissioned for an opera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon after, Mozart’s success grew rapidly beyond the various realms of musical contemporaries.

His talents knew no bounds, and after his death, Mozart’s items or any kind of properties were kept well-preserved.
